# SCPSS
Software Controlled Physical Sound Sources

This Git repo contains all the work pertaining to the sponsored Software Controlled Physical Sound Sources senior design project.

Some files included were used for testing and I would encourage to make use of these test files if there are any issues you are debugging.

The only files neccesary for using this project are the SCPSS.py module and the relay_firmware, servo_firmware, and ring_firmware arduino scripts.

## SET UP 

### Setting up Arduino IDE with ESP32-S2

### Adding WiFi credentials to ESP32-S2

### Controlling the SCPSS devices using the Python Module
